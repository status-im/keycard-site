# LOAD KEY

* CLA = 0x80
* INS = 0xD0
* P1 = key type
* P2 = 0x00
* Data = the key data
* Response SW = 0x9000 on success, 0x6A80 if the format is invalid, 0x6A86 if P1 is invalid
* Response Data = the key UID, defined as the SHA-256 of the public key
* Preconditions: Secure Channel must be opened, user PIN must be verified
* Capability: Key management

P1:
* 0x01 = ECC SECP256k1 keypair
* 0x02 = ECC SECP256k1 extended keypair
* 0x03 = Binary seed as defined in [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)

Data:

If P1 is 0x01 or 0x02
- Tag 0xA1 = keypair template
  - Tag 0x80 = ECC public key component (can be omitted)
  - Tag 0x81 = ECC private key component
  - Tag 0x82 = chain code (if P1=0x02)
  
If P1 is 0x03 a 64 byte sequence generated according to the BIP39 specifications is expected. The master key will be generated according to the [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) specifications. This is only supported if the hardware supports public key derivation.

This command is used to load or replace the keypair used for signing on the card. The PIN-less path will be reset. Unless a DERIVE KEY is sent, a subsequent SIGN command will use this keypair for signature.
